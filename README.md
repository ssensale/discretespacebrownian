These codes enable the user to calculate the mean binding time of two random walkers in 1D and 2D through a space-discretized Brownian dynamics algorithm as defined by Adib (Artur B Adib. Algorithms for brownian first-passage-time estimation. Physical Review E, 80(3):036706, 2009) and implemented by Sensale et al., Submitted.
